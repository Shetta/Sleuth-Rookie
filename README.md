# Sleuth-Cases
UoL Rookie Sleuth Cases

===About

Sleuth is a film noir themed crime adventure which teaches you the fundamentals of programming.

In the adventure, you are a fledgling private investigator working for Sleuth and Co detective agency. Your job is to use your programming skills to solve code crimes which are arranged into cases.

In total there are sixteen code cases to crack. Initially you will be a rookie and you will only see nine cases. At the mid-point of this course you will turn pro and another seven cases will be released. You can't add to your rookie grade once you've gone pro so it's important to start work right away.

During your adventure the chief will keep you on track. We're all relying on you. Good luck kid.
